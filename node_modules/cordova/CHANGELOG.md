# Cordova-cli changelog

## 3.0.9

### Features

- `platform ls` now shows both installed and available-to-install platforms. [CB-3904](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-3904)

### Bugfixes

- Plugins are now installed serially across all installed platforms, rather than in parallel. This avoids race conditions in dependency installation. [CB-4184](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-4184)
- (WP8) All files from project www dir are now copied into the binary, not the top-level www. This means merges and plugin assets are correctly handled.
